Indonesia_frel

Summary: 
Indonesia's REDD+ Forest Reference Emission Level statistics from 2012 - 2016. 
This data uses records CO2 equivalent emissions in metric tonnes.
For Indonesia FREL is calculated by totalling reference levels for Deforestation, Forest Degradation and Peat Decomposition.

Data sourced 2013-2016 on page A-35 of Biennial update report (BUR) (Appendix) ~ https://unfccc.int/documents/192165
Conservative historical data of 1990-2012 and 2019/2020 projections found page 44 ~ https://redd.unfccc.int/files/frel_submission_by__indonesia_final.pdf

Indonesia_er

Summary: 
Indonesia's REDD+ Emission reduction statistics from 2012 - 2016.
This data uses records CO2 equivalent emissions in metric tonnes.
For Indonesia emission reductions are calculated by subtracting the actual (estimated) emissions from the reference level. 
This is repeated for Deforestation, Forest Degradation and Peat Decomposition then totalled to complie REDD+ results. 
E.g. If the REDD+ result is positive there has been an improvement in emissions reductions and vis-vera
Data was created from FREL found on page A-35 (Appendix) ~ https://unfccc.int/documents/192165

Variables:
period - year
deforestation - Tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions due to deforestation above/below REDD+ FREL target
forestdegradation - Tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions due to forestdegradation above/below REDD+ FREL target
peatdecomposition - Tonnes of carbon equivalent emissions due to peatdecomposition above/below REDD+ FREL target
reddplusresults - calculated using (reference emissions-actual emissions)




Indonesia_fire 

Summary:
Indonesia's yearly total wildfire carbon emissions in megatonnes (Mt/yr). 
The data was complied from daily total wildfire carbon emissions requested from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service's (CAMS) 
Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS).
The data set can be accessed through request of Indonesia daily total wildfire carbon emissions. CAMS GFASv1.2 data

Variables:
period - the year
wildfire_emissions - yearly emissions due to wildfires
